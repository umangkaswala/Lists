**Current status: Phase 2 complete and pushed. Start Phase 3 next.**

**Process note (2026-08-17):** from Phase 2 onward, every phase gets a
`/code-review` pass on the diff after self-verification and before
committing — see CLAUDE.md's "Per-phase workflow" section. Phases 0 and 1
below predate this and were not code-reviewed.

## Phase 0 — Project bootstrap — ✅ DONE (2026-08-17, commit `6b580be`)

Built: Compose Android project skeleton, package `com.stackpointer.lists`,
exact light/dark M3 Expressive color/type/shape tokens from the design in
`ui/theme/`, empty `NavHost` with a placeholder Home screen.

Verified: built via `gradlew assembleDebug`, installed on the `Pixel_9`
emulator, launched, screenshotted — confirmed theme colors/type/shapes
render correctly against the design's exact hex values, no crash in logcat.

Known simplifications (intentional, not bugs):
- Font is `FontFamily.Default` (system Roboto), not the design's Roboto
  Flex — deferred to Phase 9 polish to avoid downloadable-font setup risk
  this early.
- ~9 Material 3 color roles the design didn't specify explicitly (secondary,
  surfaceVariant, inverse*, surfaceTint, scrim, surfaceBright/Dim, onError)
  are filled with standard M3-convention approximations, documented in
  `ui/theme/Color.kt`'s header comment.

## Phase 1 — Data layer, Home, Lists, Reminder Detail — ✅ DONE (2026-08-17, commit `9d8034c`)

Built:
- Room database (`data/db/ListsDatabase.kt`) with `ReminderEntity` (soft
  delete via `deletedAt`), `ReminderListEntity`, `ChecklistItemEntity`, and a
  schema-only `PlaceEntity` for Phase 7. Seeded with sample reminders/lists
  on first launch.
- Repositories (`ReminderRepository`, `ListRepository`) and manual DI via
  `AppContainer`/`ListsApplication`.
- **Home screen**: Today tile with live overdue/to-go counts, per-list
  tiles + filter chips, grouped sections (Overdue/Today/Upcoming), reminder
  cards with working complete-toggle and star-important-toggle, capture pill
  (visual only — Phase 2 wires it up).
- **Lists screen**: create (name + color picker), drag-to-reorder, delete
  (with a confirmation dialog warning that the list's reminders go too),
  stubbed "Shared with you" card.
- **Reminder Detail screen**: property card (due/list/repeat), note card,
  history card (stub copy until repeats exist), bottom bar with a working
  Complete button and stubbed Edit/Snooze/Share/Delete (show a "coming in a
  later phase" snackbar).

Verified end-to-end on the `Pixel_9` emulator (not just compiled): browsed
Home, toggled star and complete (confirmed the change persists across
navigating away and back — proof Room persistence actually works), created
a list with a custom color, deleted it with the confirm dialog, opened a
reminder's Detail screen and read back its due date/list/note correctly.

Bug found and fixed during this verification pass: the custom top bars on
Home/Lists/Detail were drawn under the system status bar (an
`enableEdgeToEdge()` consequence), which made the top-right buttons
genuinely untappable in roughly their top 40px, not just visually cramped.
Fixed with explicit `statusBarsPadding()`/`systemBarsPadding()` — see
CLAUDE.md's gotchas list, since this will recur on new screens if forgotten.

Not yet manually verified: dragging a list row to reorder it (create/delete
were thoroughly tested; the drag gesture itself wasn't exercised through
automation — worth a manual check next time the Lists screen is open).

## Phase 2 — Capture create/edit + Capture-When — ✅ DONE (2026-08-17, commit pending)

Built:
- **Capture bottom sheet** (`capture/CaptureSheet.kt`, `CaptureViewModel.kt`,
  `CaptureTarget.kt`): free-text title field, action-row icons (When wired;
  Where/Checklist/Photo/List show a "coming in a later phase" snackbar),
  Send button that creates or updates a reminder depending on whether it was
  opened for a new reminder or to edit an existing one.
- **When sub-editor**: all-day switch, four hardcoded quick-time preset
  chips (Later today / Tonight / Tomorrow / Next week — becomes
  Settings-driven in Phase 9), Repeat/Early alert/Alert style stub rows.
  Picking a preset returns to the typing view with a due-date chip (tap to
  reopen When, X to clear).
- Wired into: the Home capture pill, the two Home empty-state example-prompt
  buttons (added this phase — Phase 1 had left them out), and Detail's Edit
  button (previously stubbed).
- `ReminderRepository.updateReminderFields()` added for the edit path.

Verified end-to-end on the `Pixel_9` emulator: created a reminder through
the real Capture UI with a due date picked via the When quick-picks
(confirmed it appeared correctly grouped on Home); opened that reminder's
Detail screen, tapped Edit, confirmed the sheet pre-filled with its existing
title/due date, changed the title, saved, confirmed Detail reflected the
change; confirmed a stub action (Where) shows its snackbar.

**Ran `/code-review` on the diff** (first phase to do so) and it found three
real bugs, all fixed before committing:
1. Opening the Capture sheet twice in a row (e.g. save one reminder, then
   tap Edit on another) silently reused the *first* sheet's already-saved
   state, causing the second sheet to instantly self-dismiss with no
   feedback. Root cause: `androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel.compose.viewModel()`
   caches by call-site + class, and `CaptureTarget.New()` instances are
   structurally equal to each other, so Compose treated repeat opens as "the
   same" request. **I also independently found and fixed** a related bug
   during my own manual testing before the code-review ran: this same
   stale-state issue made a star-toggle appear to silently revert (it was
   actually a mistapped test coordinate, but chasing it surfaced the deeper
   pattern the review then confirmed).
2. As a consequence of fixing #1 with a naive "always-fresh key" counter,
   `/code-review` caught that every sheet-open was leaking a retained
   ViewModel for the life of the app process (nothing ever cleared the old
   keyed entries). Fixed properly by not using `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`
   for `CaptureViewModel` at all — it's now a plain class created with
   `remember(sheetKey)`, so it's garbage-collected like any other Compose
   state when the sheet closes.
3. Saving a reminder called `onDismiss()` directly from the composable body
   instead of from a `LaunchedEffect`, which skipped the bottom sheet's
   normal hide animation. Fixed.

Also found and fixed during my own manual testing (before code-review): a
`ModalBottomSheet`'s content renders in its own popup window, so the
`SnackbarHost` hosted at the NavHost level was completely invisible while
the sheet was open — tapping a stub action (e.g. "Where") produced no
visible feedback at all. Fixed by giving the Capture sheet its own
`SnackbarHost` inside its own window layer.

Not yet built (intentionally, deferred to later phases per PLAN.md):
natural-language parsing of typed text into chips (Phase 3),
Where/Checklist/Photo/List actions (Phases 4/7/8), Repeat/Early alert/Alert
style (Phase 3/9).

**Scope simplification worth flagging (my call, not pre-approved in
PLAN.md):** the When editor only offers the four quick-time presets — there
is no calendar/clock picker to set an arbitrary date or time. PLAN.md's
Phase 2 line says "date/time, hardcoded quick-time chips for now," which
could reasonably be read either way; I read it as "chips only" to keep this
phase's scope contained, but a real date/time picker may be worth pulling
forward if presets feel too limiting in practice. Flagging for the user
rather than silently deciding it's fine.

## Phases 3–12 — ⬜ NOT STARTED

See PLAN.md for full descriptions of each.

## Open product/technical TODOs carried from PLAN.md

- Recycle-bin retention length: defaulted to 30 days, not user-specified.
- Real app icon: still a placeholder.
- Voice recognition privacy disclosure wording: needed by Phase 8/9, not
  written yet.
